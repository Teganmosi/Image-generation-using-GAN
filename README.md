# Image-generation-using-GAN
This code is a script that utilizes the BigGAN model to generate images based on specified categories or interpolate between two categories.

 Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Importing Libraries:
   - TensorFlow: The `compat.v1` module from TensorFlow is imported and the v2 behavior is disabled.
   - Other necessary libraries such as `os`, `io`, `IPython.display`, `numpy`, `PIL.Image`, `scipy.stats.truncnorm`, and `tensorflow_hub` are imported.

2. Loading the BigGAN Model:
   - The code sets the `module_path` variable to the URL of the BigGAN module.
   - The TensorFlow graph is reset.
   - The BigGAN module is loaded from the specified `module_path` using TensorFlow Hub.
   - Input placeholders for the model are created based on the module's input info.
   - The output of the module is assigned to the `output` variable.
   - The inputs and output of the module are printed.

3. Helper Functions:
   - `truncated_z_sample`: Generates random noise vectors using truncated normal distribution.
   - `one_hot`: Converts an index or array of indices to a one-hot encoded representation.
   - `one_hot_if_needed`: Converts a label to one-hot encoded representation if necessary.
   - `sample`: Generates samples from the BigGAN model using provided noise and labels.
   - `interpolate`: Interpolates between two input arrays with a specified number of interpolations.
   - `imgrid`: Creates a grid of images from an input array of images.
   - `imshow`: Displays an image using IPython's display capabilities.

4. Initializing TensorFlow Session:
   - The TensorFlow session is initialized, and global variables are initialized.

5. `GAN_1` Function:
   - This function generates and displays samples from the BigGAN model based on a single category.
   - It takes a category string as input, extracts the category ID, and converts it to a one-hot label.
   - Random noise vectors are generated using `truncated_z_sample`.
   - The `sample` function is used to generate images based on the noise and label.
   - The generated images are displayed using `imshow` and `imgrid`.

6. `GAN_2` Function:
   - This function generates and displays interpolated samples between two categories.
   - It takes two category strings as input, extracts the category IDs, and converts them to one-hot labels.
   - Random noise vectors are generated for each category using `truncated_z_sample`.
   - Interpolations are computed between the noise and label arrays using `interpolate_and_shape`.
   - The `sample` function is used to generate images based on the interpolated noise and labels.
   - The generated images are displayed using `imshow` and `imgrid`.

7. Examples of Using `GAN_1`:
   - Three examples are provided, generating images for categories such as "chambered nautilus," "soft-coated wheaten terrier," and "volcano."

The script demonstrates how to use the BigGAN model to generate images from specific categories or create smooth interpolations between categories.
